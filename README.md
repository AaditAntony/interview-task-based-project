# trends

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# the reference i took to complete the login screen 

i have used mvvm architecture and riverpod for the stamanagemnt as this option is best for the clear seperation of code of business logic form the ui

i have read the riverpod statenotifier provider from the official riverpod site and https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/3.0.0-dev.16/legacy/StateNotifierProvider-class.html

i have an experience doing login page form the previous company i previously  work and the project called  Expand where i use the riverpod for statemanagement in my git hub this is the link :  https://github.com/AaditAntony/expand/branches

there is a problem with the ndk version with the sharedpreference i solve it using the debug and the appropriate version in the app inside android folder  build-gradle.kts file and that proble has been solved

for the reference i have used chat GPT and tech brother which is youtube channel  for the  reference and correction of riverpod and login state
